# cooking-converter

This is a "Practice On Your Own" assignment from the Create XML layouts for Android codelab in Google's Android Basics in Kotlin training course. The purpose of this lesson is to become familiar with creating layouts in XML instead of in the Designer. 

The app is designed to convert common cooking measurements from one unit type to another unit type, such as milliliters to fluid ounces, grams to cups, and so on. At this point, only the layout needs to be built; there is no logic behind the layout at this point.
